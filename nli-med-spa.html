							<h3>Think</h3>

							<p>

								 NLI needed a new design and front page that would stand out with beautiful pictures to go with it. Wanted to customize their plugins and also create new plugins for their landing pages. One of the main priorities for NLI was to get their ad on Google through AdWords.

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-4">

							<h3>Design</h3>

							<p>

								 Designed and developed National Laser Instituteâ€™s team and also overlooked its child company NLI MedSpa. Designed new landing pages and its integration with both WordPress and Pardot. Customization of existing plugins was also required. Developed a plugin to create new landings pages on the go. 

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-4">

							<h3>Build</h3>

							<p>

								 Once the website was built, I added all the fillers including pictures, content and videos. I created the site layout to show the most artistically and appealing look. The design of the landing page was put through many tests and different wireframes were built to improve readability and user friendliness.
