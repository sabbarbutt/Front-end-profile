							<h3>Think</h3>

							<p>

								 Austin Bazaar is a popular online music equipment store, but their website design had become outdated and lacked key features that were essential for a better and easier user experience. Initially I was responsible for improve the existing design and add new features and improve site's real estate usage.

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-4">

							<h3>Design</h3>

							<p>

								 Once I had identified key space usage issues and a better flow for the website. For that, I created a number of mockups with different features and submitted them for approval. I discussed the mock-ups extensively with Client and came to a finalized version for development.

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-4">

							<h3>Build</h3>

							<p>

								 I created html for the approved mockups and deployed them on AB's dev site. Once testing was complete and final changes were approved, the new changes were published on the live website.

							<h3>Improved Deals Visibility</h3>

							<p>

								 An important factor on any marketing site, it was important to create proper space to fit best deals Austin Bazaar had to offer. Integrating the deals into the Magneto system was done once the site was built

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-md-4">

							<h3>Improved Site Space Usage</h3>

							<p>

								 Improving the way products were displayed was important as well. I made sure to improve the flow of the website. Deals stood out, and products stood out below them, with a side navigation for ease of access. 

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-md-4">

							<h3>Added New Cart Functionalities</h3>

							<p>

								 I integrated a new cart, this allowed for customers to add products to their Wishlist, and also the ability to determine the quantity of a certain product to be placed in the cart.
