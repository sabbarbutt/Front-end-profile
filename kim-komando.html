							<h3>Think</h3>

							<p>

								 The redesign and structuring of Kim Kamando was a complex and delicate matter; since the site had a high up keep, and the client wanted many new functionalities to add to the site. I had to find a way to tackle this issue; Implantation of the restructuring while allowing the site to maintain its user inflow, with continuously added functionalities.

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-4">

							<h3>Design</h3>

							<p>

								 In my attempt to improve the site’s design while adapting to new and improved functionalities added to the site constantly, I made several mock-ups to adjust the content and functionality. The Client and I finalized the design currently being used, which accommodates all the client’s needs while giving a brand new outlook to the site.

							<h3>Build</h3>

							<p>

								 Kim Komando’s site had two sections, There was a Blog and a Store section; I was responsible for building out the blog for the site. The blog was built out on WordPress; and I was able to create custom plugins to put together the functionality required by the Client.

							<h3>New Draft URL Generation</h3>

							<p>

								 Any blog needs to have writers, editors, and administrators. In order to create a better edited and share-worthy blog; I was tasked with creating URLs for draft posts so writers could quickly share drafts with editors and get the correct information to the Public

							</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-md-4">

							<h3>Backend User Accessibility to Content</h3>

							<p>

								 Heavy Traffic on any website means layers of administrative control, in order to keep a close controlled check on the access to content I developed special functions to enhance the Super admin’s level of control over content management.

							<h3>Custom Counter</h3>

							<p>

								 Everyone loves a countdown; so for Kim Komando I set-up a site-wide countdown for every weeks show. This way users on the site waiting to tune into the show won’t miss a second.
